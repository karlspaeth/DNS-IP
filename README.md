# DNS-IP
This powershell script takes input from a newline separated text file of FQDNs and preforms an nslookup and ping. Outputs to an Excel spreadsheet.

Within the same folder as the ps1 file create "list.txt". Paste in the list of hostnames, FQDNs, or even IPs if you just want to check if they are alive. The list needs to be seperated by newlines.
